## Why I Built This

I wanted a dedicated space on the internet that's truly mine — somewhere people can easily learn about me and what I've been working on.

More than just a landing page, I needed a place to organise my side projects, experiments, and case studies. Scattered GitHub repos and random notes weren't cutting it. Having everything in one place helps me:

- **Track what I've built** — Easy to forget projects after a few months
- **Share my work** — A single link to send to anyone curious about my projects
- **Reflect on learning** — Writing about projects helps solidify what I learned

## Tech Stack

Built this with a modern, minimal stack:

- **Astro** — Static site generator with great content management. Perfect for a portfolio since it ships zero JavaScript by default.
- **TypeScript** — Type safety for components and content schemas
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling with the typography plugin for beautiful prose
- **MDX** — Markdown with components for writing project content
- **Biome** — Fast linter and formatter (replaced ESLint + Prettier)

## What I Learned

A few things stood out during the build:

### Astro's Content Collections

The content collection system is really nice. Define a schema once, and you get full type safety when querying content. The project templates (side-project, case-study, experiment) made it easy to have different layouts for different types of content.

### Tailwind Typography Plugin

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin handles all the prose styling — headings, paragraphs, code blocks, lists. Just add the `prose` class and it looks great out of the box.

### Keeping It Simple

The biggest win was resisting the urge to over-engineer. No complex state management, no heavy frameworks. Just static HTML with great developer experience. The site loads fast and is easy to maintain.

## What's Next

- Add more projects as I build them
- Maybe add a blog section later

For now, it does exactly what I needed — a clean home for my work.
