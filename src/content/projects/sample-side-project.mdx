## Why I Made This

Every morning standup, same story: "What did I work on yesterday?" 

I'd scramble through my terminal history, check GitHub, maybe look at Slack messages. It was annoying. So I built a thing that just tells me.

## What It Does

Run `git-standup` in any git repo and it shows you:

- Commits from yesterday (or any date range)
- Which branches you touched
- Files you modified

That's it. Nothing fancy.

```bash
$ git-standup

Yesterday you worked on:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📁 feature/user-auth (3 commits)
   • Add login form validation
   • Fix password reset flow  
   • Update auth middleware

📁 main (1 commit)
   • Bump version to 2.1.0

12 files changed across 4 commits
```

## How I Built It

First time using Rust for a CLI tool. Picked it because:
1. I wanted to learn Rust
2. Single binary = easy to distribute
3. It's fast (not that this tool needs to be, but still)

Used `clap` for argument parsing and `git2` for interacting with git repos. The git2 crate is a bit verbose but well-documented.

### The Tricky Part

Figuring out "yesterday" sounds simple until you realize:
- What if it's Monday? Should it show Friday?
- What about different timezones in commit timestamps?
- What counts as "your" commits in a shared repo?

I ended up just using author email matching and treating weekends as workdays. Good enough for my use case.

## What I Learned

- Rust's error handling is nice once you get used to `?` and `Result`
- The `chrono` crate handles dates way better than I could
- CLIs are a great way to learn a new language - small scope, immediate feedback

## Try It

```bash
cargo install git-standup

# Or download a binary from releases
```

Would love feedback if you try it out!
