# Project Cover Images

Place your project cover images here for automatic optimization.

## Usage

1. Add your image to this folder (e.g., `my-project.png`)
2. In your project's MDX frontmatter, reference it:

```yaml
---
title: "My Project"
cover: "../../assets/projects/my-project.png"
---
```

## Recommended Specs

- **Dimensions**: 1200x675px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG (will be converted to WebP automatically)
- **Size**: Keep under 500KB for faster builds

Astro will automatically optimize these images during build.
